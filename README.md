# Managing Personal Meetings
A console application for managing your personal meetings

## Description
A meeting is an event that is planned in advance, for which the start time and approximate end time are always known.
Meeting data can be added, modified, and deleted. Meetings are always planned only for the future. At the same time, meetings should not overlap with each other. 
Also, the time for which you need to notify the user about the upcoming meeting can be configured for the meeting. The reminder time can also be changed after the appointment is created. When the reminder time arrives, the application informs the user about the upcoming meeting and the time of its start.
The user can view the schedule of their meetings for any day, including the past one. 
In addition to viewing, he can use the application to export the schedule of meetings for the selected day to a text file.
